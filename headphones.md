# My Headphones
## My headphones are JBL over-ear noise-canceling headphones that connect to my phone via bluetooth.
### I cannot leave my house without my headphones because I am constantly listening to music, whether it's for fun or for mood regulation. The noise-canceling helps quiet down loud environments because I tend to get overstimulated if I am exposed to too much stimulation for too long. When I'm not using them, I just wear them around my neck, so there is never any harm in bringing them even if I don't end up using them.
