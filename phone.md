# My Phone
## My phone is my main information and communication source, but it also has my wallet attached to the back of the case. My wallet has my student ID, my credit card, and my driver's license. 
### I can't leave the house without my phone because I need my license to drive anywhere, my credit card to buy anything, and directions to any unfamiliar places.
